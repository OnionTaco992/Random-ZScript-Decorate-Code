# Random-ZScript-Decorate-Code
Random code I have made for random ZScript/Decorate mods for GZDoom. Some will probably not be finished.

--CustomWeapons.WAD--

Some wad I made last year. I think I remember having a heat seaking rocket launcher, but I think I removed it because it didn't work correctly. It contains some weird cube weapon that deals a ton of damage. Also has a burst pistol and a purple armour. Just look at the ZSCRIPT file.
